An interactive digital twin of a corn plant that visually reflects live environmental conditions. This web app simulates real-time weather behaviors like rain and displays soil data to help monitor plant health. Designed to support future integration of machine learning for yield prediction and stress analysis.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Real-Time Weather Integration**  
  Live weather data updates the plantâ€™s animation based on current conditions (e.g., rain, sunlight, wind).

- **Soil Metrics Dashboard**  
  Displays soil moisture, pH, and nitrogen levels using data from remote sensing and/or simulated sensors.

- **3D Corn Plant Visualization**  
  A dynamic visual representation of a corn plant built with 3D graphics, reacting to environmental inputs.

- **Machine Learning Ready**  
  Built with an extendable structure to support predictive analytics like crop yield forecasting and plant stress detection.

- **Responsive Web Design**  
  Optimized for various devices with a clean, intuitive UI.

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js, Next.js  
- **3D Visualization:** Three.js  
- **APIs:** OpenWeather API, SoilGrids API  
- **Database:** MongoDB    
- **Hosting:** Vercel (mention what you used)

## ðŸ“ˆ Future Plans

- Integrate ML models for yield prediction using soil and weather data
- Add historical data tracking and comparison tools
- Implement crop stress and disease detection system
- Build support for other crops beyond corn
